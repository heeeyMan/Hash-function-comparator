# Hash-function-comparator
This project is dedicated to the topic of calculating the running time of a hash function. Here we compare the running time of the hash function in Kotlin and in C++.

For the purity of the experiment, one algorithm was implemented.

You can see that with an increase in the number of characters, the function written in Kotlin works much slower than a similar function in C++.
